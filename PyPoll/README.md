 header need to be skipped
 step 2:assigning the variable, we need to break down the information.
 step 3:we need to find the total vote count once we separated the vote count and candidate from given data set.
 step 4:we need to filter the participated candidate.which is how many candidate are participating in a given vote.
 step 5:once we have list of participant we can determine how many vote each of them recieved.
 step 6:we need to fid the percentage of the voted for each candidate.
            percentage is equal to each count divided by total count times 100
step7 to get the winner out of the participant;we need to create the variable and pick the maximum vote and its respective participant.

step 8 we need to write the election result to text file.
 note:once it is open as write mode we dont have to create file manualy.it will create the .txt file to the desired path.

# module 3 assignment 
# pybank analysis of financial record.
# instruction
# we need to break down the information to series of step to solve it.
step 1:we need to import the desire module from python library.
step 2:we need to put the file directory.
step 3 we need to open the file in read mode.
step 4:once we open the file we need to create the intial value of the desired variable.
step 5: we need to break down the csv_reader file that was open as read mode into months_list and profit/loss.
step 6: once we break it down we can find the count of the month or how many month were given 
step 7:we need to convert the profit/loss to integer with new variable in order to find the max value.the highest number in the list  is the maximum number.
step 8:based on the maximum number we can find the maximum value of the index date.(the date associated with the maximum value)
step 9:we can find the average change using the indexed date.which is the value when the opening period and closing period
       the opening period is the value at index 0 of the list and the closing period is at the index value of (-1)
       so,the average is the value closing period minus opening period

step 10:we can write the analysis to a text file.
    # note the highest increased profit in the assignment 
    the highest decrease profit
the average change are not thesame results from what is found during analysis.
